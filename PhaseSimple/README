This program calculates 2D grain growth using Kobayashi-Warren-Carter
theory, described in Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena Vol 140. Iss. 2, pp 141-150.

In future I plan to add rudimentary fluid flow code to be able to simulate
the rippening and segregation under flow regime.

Implemented new solver SLAP 2.0. The solver is tested with TestSLAP.nb
program. It was tested with given matrix coefficients with the fixed size.
Matrix coefficients are probably not correct, it needs testing.
